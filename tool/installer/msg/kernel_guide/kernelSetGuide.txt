 It is first necessary to set your system environment to ensure that ALTIBASE XDB
 will run properly. Before installing ALTIBASE XDB, the kernel parameter values
 must be set using the root user account. The kernel parameter values may be
 modified after installation; however, they must be set prior to starting 
 ALTIBASE XDB.

 Please refer to the installation manual
 or $ALTIBASE_XDB_HOME/install/kernelSetGuide.txt.
